I'm Igor, currently an applied scientist at Amazon AWS AI Labs working on Conversational NLP. I obtained my PhD from the [Interaction Lab, Heriot-Watt University](https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/) (Edinburgh, UK) working under the supervision of [Prof. Oliver Lemon](https://sites.google.com/site/olemon/) and [Dr. Arash Eshghi](https://sites.google.com/site/araesh81/) on Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing methods for data-efficient, robust, and practically applicable dialogue systems. If you think my background could be useful for you, please feel free to contact me.
